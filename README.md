# Heat Equation Test
by rbasamoyai

---

This code is a prototype for heat equation calculations in 1D. This code is the
prototype preceding the Java prototype implementation found at
https://github.com/rbasamoyai/HeatEqTestJava, and is older than the Java implementation.
The goal is to incorporate the Java prototype into *Create: Mother of All Reactors (MOAR)*,
an in-development *Minecraft* Java mod and addon for the *Create* mod. This
prototype is intended to analyze the potential computational performance of
the model and diagnose any code issues. This code is implemented in pure Python.

Unlike in the Java implementation, visualization is done with Matplotlib. No files
are written.

This code is mainly based on work by Cen, Hoppe, and Gu (2016). You can find the
